## Introduction

The latest code and data for Coling 2018 paper "Learning Target-specific Representations of Financial News Documents for Cumulative Abnormal Return Prediction."  We have applied the model to two different tasks, i.e., Cumulative Abnormal Return Prediction and Document-level Stance Detection

## Cumulative Abnormal Return Prediction

The codes and data can be found in abrt_code/ and abrt_data/ directories, respectively.


## Document-level Stance Detection

The codes and data can be found in stance_code/ and stance_data/ directories, respectively.
