caliph and we are none the wiser . </s> could it be telling that the news of his death apparently leaked out from isis itself ? </s> so far , u.s. officials are working on inference . </s> late on friday night , american warplanes hit a ten-car convoy southwest of mosul , which functions as isiss capital in northern iraq . </s> among the 20 people thought to have been killed was auf abdulrahman elefery , who is known by his code name abu sajar , a key aide to baghdadi . </s> if abu sajar was there , it is likely that baghdadi was too , though he may also be among the casualties who were rushed to mosul hospitals , where there were urgent appeals over loudspeakers for blood donations . </s> according to iraqi sources , parallel attacks on qaim in anbar province killed one of the terror group 's top strategists in a predominantly sunni region where isis has made huge military advances in recent weeks as the worlds attention was distracted by its relentless siege of kobane in northern syria . </s> normally so effusive on social media , isis are being strangely coy about the losses it may have sustained this weekend , though it has started arresting former members of the iraqi army lest they are providing the us with actionable intelligence . </s> isis is probably scouring their deep substitute bench for replacements for anyone killed , including baghdadi himself . </s> baghdadi has made a lifelong virtue of anonymity , especially since his al qaeda mentor , abu musab al-zarqawi was killed in a u.s. bombing raid in 2006 . </s> except for his brief appearance in mosul in july to proclaim himself caliph ( an office that fuses political and religious leadership ) , baghdadi has kept a low profile , so that the fate of isis does not appear to hinge on his personal survival . </s> it also offers the perfect cover should baghdadi wish to disappear for a while , homeland-style . </s> for baghdadi has been careful to organize isis in such a way that power is highly decentralised , with a clear division between those responsible for administering territories the terror group controls and those who direct its military operations . </s> isis has been careful to include many sunni tribal figures in administration , precisely to pre-empt any u.s. attempt to trigger a tribal uprising against them , a strategy the americans pursued against al qaeda in iraq ( isiss forerunner ) in 2007-08 with some success . </s> targeted : baghdadi was reportedly wounded on friday night when american warplanes hit a ten-car isis convoy like this one southwest of mosul , which functions as isis 's capital in northern iraq ( file picture ) isiss military command includes at least two sunni muslim iraqi army generals on the run since the saddam era , who clearly have considerable tactical ability . </s> isis has used lightning advances and exemplary terror as well as suicide bombers to destroy enemy command and control centres . </s> they also use the destruction of bridges and controlled flooding to shape battlefields to their choosing , and the deployment of roadside bombs and embedded tanks to inhibit countermoves by their iraqi or kurdish opponents . </s> so far , the u.s. response has been to remove the unpopular shia prime minister of iraq , to reduce the alienation of the countrys sunni and limited efforts to restore the fighting morale of the iraqi national army , which , poorly led , effectively fled from this ferocious opponent . </s> the only effective obstacles to isis taking over the country have been shia militias in baghdad and further south , and the kurdish peshmerga in the north . </s> although the u.s. has added a further 1,500 military advisers , bringing their total strength to over 3000 , they have to be careful since the same shia militias are restive about a renewed u.s. occupation of iraq . </s> american airstrikes have been criticised as a drizzle when what is required resembles a cloud burst in a thunder storm . </s> so far there have been an average of five strikes a day , compared with 50 in libya in 2011 , 85 in afghanistan , and 800 a day in iraq itself during the 2003 us-led invasion . </s> so far , only 800 of the 3 , 200 sorties over iraq and syria have actually involved dropping bombs or firing missiles . </s> until these raids at the weekend , there has been an absence of actionable intelligence from the ground , while pentagon lawyers are being ultra cautious about avoiding any civilian casualties . </s> the long distance planes have to fly from bases in qatar or the uae , or from carriers in the persian gulf , also makes it hard for them to loiter looking for targets of opportunity . </s> so while it would be a significant blow to isis to lose its self-styled caliph , he is replaceable in what in practice is a collective leadership with many experienced and hardened personalities . </s> and he may yet rise from the dead .

's expansion during the 1990s . </s> terms of the latest deals were not disclosed , but sources estimated the redwood city sale at around $ 625 per square foot , or $ 583.75 million . </s> that would make it perhaps google 's single largest real estate acquisition by footprint and dollar amount ever in silicon valley . </s> `` `` i welcome them to our city and i look forward to working with them , '' '' said redwood city mayor jeffrey gee in an interview this afternoon . </s> `` `` for a long time i would go around and say , 'redwood city is one of the best kept secrets in the bay area . </s> with google and everything going on , we 're not a secret anymore .

'' '' </s> still , that could actually be a good thing for tenants down the line by pushing developers to build more product , she added . </s> `` `` this deal essentially eliminates a significant portion of new development , which could prompt more developers to move forward , '' '' she said . </s> jim beeger , a veteran broker with colliers international , said in the short term , the sunnyvale deal could also push tenants back into the market . </s> the transaction could `` '' cause tenants of all sizes to realize they should have more of a sense of urgency in their search for a new site , '' '' he said . </s> `` `` moffett place will be difficult to replicate , and those who lingered no longer have this option . '' '' </s> sethena leiker , senior analyst for cushman & wakefield 's silicon valley office , agreed . </s> `` `` there 's not a lot of spec development coming , '' '' she said . </s> `` `` if you want to take any new space , you 're going to have to take something that 's proposed . '' '' </s> one result , beeger said , could be a `` '' trickle-down effect '' '' of growing tenants moving to other areas of santa clara county that have available sites . </s> score for sunnyvale google 's lease at moffett place is a huge win for san francisco-based jay paul co. , if one that 's not entirely unexpected . </s> jay paul already leased 949,000 square feet to google in sunnyvale at a nearby campus called technology corners , making google a natural prospect for the new development . </s> and while google has not yet started moving into technology corners , the company has also been growing elsewhere in sunnyvale this year , snapping up the old juniper networks headquarters ( 424,000 square feet ) and former head office of palm computing inc. ( 285,000 square feet ) . </s> and it 's rumored that a fund , cbre global investors , that 's buying up land all around sunnyvale 's moffett park business district is actually acting on behalf of google . </s> yet landing google was n't guaranteed when jay paul started building moffett place earlier this year on spec . </s> other major tech tenants were also making offers on the property , according to sources . </s> the rent google is paying is n't known , but jay paul was asking $ 3.75 per square foot on a triple-net basis , or not including utilities , taxes and fees . </s> redwood city action in redwood city , google picks a up a major chunk one of silicon valley 's marquee office campuses . </s> the 10-building , 1.7-million-square-foot project was built by jay paul co. in the early 2000s and gained notice for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools , a rock-climbing wall , day spa and baseball diamonds . </s> starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $ 833 million , and immediately sold two buildings to shorenstein , the san francisco-based landlord . </s> blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago . </s> informatica also acquired two buildings out of the 10 in 2012 for $ 525 per square foot . </s> google 's acquisition this week is only for the six blackstone/starwood buildings . </s> as i reported earlier this month , a new owner could build even more office space at pacific shores . </s> new zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet . </s> google which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom may have been attracted to the project partly for its water transit possibilities beyond freeways . </s> pacific shores is a half mile from the port of redwood city , where a google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from san francisco and alameda to the port . </s> mayor gee said the city would be happy to work with google on such a plan , should the search company decide to go in that direction . </s> `` `` one of the things that 's always a challenge with new forms of transportation is , is there enough there there , '' '' he said . </s> `` `` with google , that potentially brings the there there .
